# he term polymorphism refers to a function or method taking different forms in different contexts.
# There are four ways to implement polymorphism in Python âˆ’ Duck typing, Operator Overloading, Method Overloading, Method Overriding.
class Duck:
    def sound(self):
        return "Quack, quack!"

class AnotherBird:
    def sound(self):
        return "I'm similar to a duck!"

def makeSound(duck):
    print(duck.sound())

# creating instances
duck = Duck()
anotherBird = AnotherBird()
# calling methods
makeSound(duck)
makeSound(anotherBird)

# Method Overriding in Python
